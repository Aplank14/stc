      <div>
        Founded in 2020 during the Covid 19 crisis, we believe that all businesses matter. As the bailouts happened, our small businesses were left behind. We did not see the stimulus fit for them or its employees. We believe in providing them free exposure so that they can grow their business and continue their legacies.

      <div>Our team is committed to adding all small businesses to our website and are constantly expanding our borders. Please feel free to email us at alskdj@test.com and let us know about a new one and we would love to add it!</div>
